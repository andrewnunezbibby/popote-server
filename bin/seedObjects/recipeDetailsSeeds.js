      "Arrange oven rack in the middle of the oven and preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line a large baking sheet with parchment. Cut squash in half along the equator and scoop out the seeds. Lay cut-side down on the prepared baking sheet and roast until soft, 45 minutes to 1 hour depending on the size of the squash. To check if it is done, carefully press on the skin of the squash. You should feel the flesh give slightly. Let cool, cut side up at least 10 minutes before handling. Using two spoons, carefully scoop the flesh from one side out into a food processor. Add ½ cup of the heated broth and process until completely smooth, scraping down the sides as necessary. Transfer to a medium bowl. Repeat with the remaining squash and broth. Heat oil and garlic in a small skillet over medium heat, stirring or shaking the skillet until it starts to sizzle. Continue cooking until the garlic is just turning golden in spots, 2 to 5 minutes. Immediately add the herbs and remove from the heat. Pour the oil mixture into the squash puree. Add the salt and pepper and stir until completely combined.",

      "INSTRUCTIONS\n\nPlace chicken thighs in a single layer on a baking tray. Sprinkle all over with salt, ground pepper, and spice rub on both sides. Do the same for the wingettes.\n\nPreheat grill to medium (about 350F/180C).\n\nBrush some vegetable oil on the grates. Arrange chicken thighs skin side up on the grates, leaving one side for chicken wingettes later. Close the lid and grill chicken thighs for 15 minutes at 350F/180C.\n\nOpen the lid and flip the chicken thighs.\n\nArrange chicken wingettes on the empty side of the grill. Brush some oil on the meat side of flipped chicken thighs. Close the lid and grill for 7 to 8 minutes.\n\nOpen the lid and flip the wingettes. Close the lid and continue to grill for another 7 minutes. Watch closely for flare-ups by opening the lid occasionally. Move chicken thighs and wingettes to a different part of the grill to avoid charring if flare-ups occur.\n\nOpen the lid and transfer chicken thighs and wingettes to the top rack in the grill. Cover the lid and continue to cook for another 5 minutes.\n\nWhen cooked, chicken thighs should have an internal temperature of about 175F to 180F /79C to 82C.\n\nRemove chicen thighs and wingettes from the grill onto a platter. Cover loosely with aluminum foil and allow them to rest for 5 minutes before serving.",

        "Oreo Cookies works really well with Cream Sherry, Madeira, and Prosecco. A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. The NV Solera Cream Sherry with a 4.5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 17 dollars per bottle.",

        "Chocolate Covered Strawberries can be paired with Cream Sherry, Moscato d'Asti, and Port. A common wine pairing rule is to make sure your wine is sweeter than your food. Delicate desserts go well with Moscato d'Asti, nutty desserts with cream sherry, and caramel or chocolate desserts pair well with port. The NV Johnson Estate Cream Sherry with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 19 dollars per bottle.",

      "Instructions\n\nTo clean strawberries: for organically grown strawberries place in a colander and rinse well under cold running water, tossing occasionally, drain well. For conventionally grown strawberries soak in a solution of 4 parts water 1 part vinegar for 5 minutes. Rinse and drain well in a colander.\n\nDry strawberries: Dry each strawberry individually very well with paper towels, then set aside to continue to dry while melting chocolate. If strawberries are wet chocolate won't stick and you don't want any water in the chocolate mixture.\n\nHow to melt chocolate microwave option: Add chocolate chips and coconut oil to a small microwave safe mixing bowl. Heat mixture in microwave in 20 second intervals, stirring well between each interval until melted and smooth.\n\nIf chocolate is runny let it cool just briefly to thicken up slightly before you begin to dip berries.\n\nHow to melt chocolate stovetop directions: Place chocolate chips and coconut oil in a heat proof bowl (such as glass or stainless steel bowl) that sits well over a saucepan.\n\nBring about 1-inch of water to a simmer in saucepan, reduce heat to low, set bowl with chocolate over saucepan. Heat, stirring constantly until chocolate has melted. Remove from heat.\n\nTo dip strawberries in chocolate: Set a sheet of parchment paper over a baking sheet. Working with one strawberry at a time dip, hold the strawberry by the leaves and dip into melted chocolate, coating nearly to the top. Tilt bowl as needed to pool chocolate to one side, and rotate strawberry to coat all sides as needed.\n\nLift and let excess chocolate run off, slide strawberry across the inside edge of the bowl to remove just some of the chocolate then set that side facing down on parchment paper (if dipping in toppings then dip before transferring to baking sheet).\n\nRepeat with remaining strawberries. Transfer dipped strawberries to refrigerator and let chocolate harden, about 15 minutes.\n\nTo finish with a chocolate drizzle (optional): Melt (1/2 cup) 2 oz. chocolate chips (dark, milk or white) with 3/4 tsp coconut oil as directed in step 3 or 5 above.\n\nTransfer melted chocolate to a small resealable bag, seal bag and cut a tiny corner from one point. Drizzle over chocolate set strawberries, return to fridge to solidify.\n\nHow to Store Strawberries: Store strawberries in a single layer an airtight container in refrigerator, for best results enjoy within about 12 hours.",

            "The deep, ruby-red color is an initial clue as to the intensity of this wine. The nose combines roasted coffee, Satsuma plum and allspice, with more subtle notes of red currant, licorice and wet earth. Concentrated flavors of plum, coffee and cola complement the textural finesse of the silky mid-palate. Muscular but fine tannins define the long, broad finish while vanilla, bittersweet chocolate and cherry complete the experience.",

        "No one wine will suit every pasta dish. Pasta in a tomato-based sauce will usually work well with a medium-bodied red, such as a montepulciano or chianti. Pasta with seafood or pesto will fare better with a light-bodied white, such as a pinot grigio. Cheese-heavy pasta can pair well with red or white - you might try a sangiovese wine for hard cheeses and a chardonnay for soft cheeses. We may be able to make a better recommendation if you ask again with a specific pasta dish.",

    instructions:
      "Place eggs and squid ink in a blender and mix on low speed for a second or two until uniformly colored.Combine flours in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and mix briefly to combine. Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients and pour in egg mixture. Turn mixer to low speed until combined. Remove paddle and attach dough hook; knead on low speed for 3 to 4 minutes or until dough, while it might appear crumbly, will stick together when squeezed. If your dough seems particularly, add a teaspoon or two of water until dough just comes together. Alternatively, if its still sticky, knead in some more flour until its nice and smooth.Press dough into a ball; split in half and shape each half into a squashed ball. Wrap tightly in plastic wrap and allow to rest at cool room temperature for an hour, or in the fridge for longer (let return to room temperature for 30 minutes prior to rolling).Attach the flat roller to your mixer (or follow manufacturers instructions for other pasta rollers). Adjustment roller thickness to 1 (the thickest setting).Cut each dough ball into quarters. Using your hand, press and flatten one piece of dough to about 3/8-inch thick. Turn on the mixer to low speed and feed dough through rollers.Dust of excess flour and then fold the rolled dough into thirds, keeping the width of the piece approximately 4-5 inches. Lightly dust with more flour as needed, then feed the dough through again. Repeat this rolling and folding process once or twice more until the dough is smooth (you are basically kneading the dough and establishing the shape/width of the dough).Once smooth, stop folding, and start increasing the roller settings one notch at a time until the desired thinness is achieved. For fettuccine noodles, I recommend going up to 6 or 7.Lightly flour rolled strip of dough and set aside while you roll out the remaining dough.Remove roller attachment and attach desired cutting attachments (I used the fettuccine cutter). On medium-low speed, feed each rolled piece of dough through the cutter. Dust noodles liberally with a mix of flour and semolina flour, then either spread pasta out on a pasta drying rack, or gather into loose bundles. Pasta can be used immediately or frozen for up to 1 month.Cooking instructions: fresh pasta cooks very quickly compared to commercial dried pastas. Cook in a pot of boiling salted water for about 2-3 minutes or until al dente (slightly more or less if you used a thicker/thinner setting).",

Turn on the mixer to low speed and feed dough through rollers.Dust of excess flour and then fold the rolled dough into thirds, keeping the width of the piece approximately 4-5 inches. Lightly dust with more flour as needed, then feed the dough through again. Repeat this rolling and folding process once or twice more until the dough is smooth (you are basically kneading the dough and establishing the shape/width of the dough).Once smooth, stop folding, and start increasing the roller settings one notch at a time until the desired thinness is achieved. For fettuccine noodles, I recommend going up to 6 or 7.Lightly flour rolled strip of dough and set aside while you roll out the remaining dough.",

        "No one wine will suit every pasta dish. Pasta in a tomato-based sauce will usually work well with a medium-bodied red, such as a montepulciano or chianti. Pasta with seafood or pesto will fare better with a light-bodied white, such as a pinot grigio. Cheese-heavy pasta can pair well with red or white - you might try a sangiovese wine for hard cheeses and a chardonnay for soft cheeses. We may be able to make a better recommendation if you ask again with a specific pasta dish.",

        "Gnocchi works really well with Chianti, Trebbiano, and Verdicchio. Italians know food and they know wine. Trebbiano and Verdicchio are Italian white wines that pair well with fish and white meat, while Chianti is a great Italian red for heavier, bolder dishes. You could try Cecchi Chianti Classico. Reviewers quite like it with a 4 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 11 dollars per bottle.",

On the palate, it is harmonized by a dry, full flavor. On the nose, it is full, rich and vinous, characterized by hints of violets.",

      "Instructions\n\nAdd mashed potatoes, egg, and a pinch of salt to a large mixing bowl.\nAdd 1/4 cup of flour to the bowl and gently stir to combine. The amount of flour you need will vary based on your mashed potato recipe  I find I usually need around 1 cup to get a gnocchi consistency I like. I recommend adding flour 1/4 cup at a time until the dough feels right. You can mix the first bit of flour in with a spoon or spatula, but after that its helpful to use your hands to finish mixing. When the dough is ready, it should be soft and light, but not sticky. Avoid overworking the dough  this can cause chewy, gummy gnocchi.\nLightly flour a large cutting board and a sheet pan or large plate.\nUse a knife to divide gnocchi dough into 4 or 5 sections. Place one section of dough on the cutting board and use your hands to gently roll it into a long rope, about 1/2 thick. If the dough gets sticky as you roll it, dust it with some extra flour.\nUse a knife to cut the rope of dough into 1/2 pieces  these are your gnocchi! Transfer the cut gnocchi to your lightly floured sheet pan and repeat the rolling and cutting process with the remaining dough. If youd like, you can roll each gnocco across a gnocchi board or the tines of a fork to form ridges (see recipe notes).\nBring a large pot of water to a boil and add a generous pinch or two of salt.\nCarefully add gnocchi to boiling water give them a gentle stir. Cook for 2-3 minutes until gnocchi float to the top of the water. Drain and toss with your favorite sauce.\n\nFor the sauce: For these photos, I melted 4 Tbsp. of unsalted butter in a skillet with fresh rosemary, basil, salt, and pepper, then tossed it with the gnocchi and a splash of the gnocchis cooking liquid. The gnocchi are topped with shaved parmesan, an extra dusting of fresh ground black pepper, and fresh basil. I also love these gnocchi with tomato sauce, browned butter and sage, garlic alfredo, or my parmesan spinach gnocchi recipe!",

        "Merlot, Pinot Noir, and rosé Wine are great choices for Tuna. Though fish is often paired with white wine, 'meatier' fish like tuna can absolutely go with red wine. A Rosé will also pair nicely, particularly if your tunan is prepared with ingredients better suited to a white wine. The Director's Merlot with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 21 dollars per bottle.",

            "Our 2014 Director's Merlot offers lushness and a round, full palate. Its fragrance demonstrates red and black fruit with hints of anise and spiced wood. Juicy upon entry, the wine broadens and becomes velvety on the palate with flavors of plum, loganberry and black cherry accentuated by subtle spice notes of espresso bean and toasted vanilla. Medium tannins support the body of this wine, offering sophistication in its finish. Pairs nicely with brisket, grilled pork chops and linguine with pesto.",

      "You will need to start this recipe in the morning for dinner or the night before for lunch.Place quinoa in a fine-mesh strainer and rinse thoroughly with cool water for at least 2 minutes. Drain. Rinsing quinoa before cooking will remove its natural bitter or soapy taste. Do not skip this step!Place quinoa in a bowl and cover with water. Set aside to soak on the counter for at least 8 hours. When you're ready to prepare the pizza, preheat oven to 425F - 220C.Drain quinoa and rinse thoroughly again.Place in your food processor with 1/4 cup water, salt and baking powder. Process for about 2 minutes, scraping edges if needed, or until very smooth.Line a 9-inch / 22 cm cake pan (like this one) with parchment paper. Place the cake pan on top of the parchment paper, draw an outline of it, cut it out, and place it into the cake pan.Pour olive oil on top of the parchment and spread it by lightly shaking the pan. It's alright if the oil goes underneath the paper.Pour quinoa mixture in the pan and spread it by lightly shaking the pan until smooth.Bake for 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and carefully flip the crust, using a spatula. Bake for another 5 minutes.Top with your favorite toppings and cook for another 5 minutes (more or less depending on your topping). Cut and serve. For toppings ideas, check out these recipes: Quinoa Pizza with Pesto and Mozzarella  Skinny Buffalo Chicken Pizza",
